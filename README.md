## What is DDEV Unlighthouse Add-on?

This is a [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) addon to run Unlighthouse in your site. [Unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev/) is a tool to scan your entire site with Google Lighthouse in 2 minutes (on average).

This is optimized for [Aljibe projects](https://github.com/Metadrop/Aljibe/), but can be used in any DDEV project.


## Getting Started

Install this addon:

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```sh
ddev add-on get Metadrop/ddev-unlighthouse
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```sh
ddev get Metadrop/ddev-unlighthouse
```

Once installed, make sure to restart your ddev project:

```sh
ddev restart
```

### Configuration

This addon uses the `tests/[local|pro|....]/unlighthouse.ts` configuration file to customize tests according to your needs. You can modify this file following Unlighthouse configuration guidelines.

### Running Tests

To execute unlighthouse tests, simply access your ddev environment and run the following command:

`ddev unlighthouse <folder>[local|pre|pro...]`

Lighthouse will generate detailed reports and save them in the `reports/unlighthouse` folder of your project.

### Interpreting Results

Once unlighthouse reports are generated, you can review them to identify areas for improvement in performance, accessibility, and more of your website.

Happy optimization!
